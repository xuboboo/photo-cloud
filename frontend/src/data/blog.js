# 10 Mobile Photography Tips

Your smartphone camera is powerful. Here's how to use it like a pro.

## 1. Clean Your Lens

Always wipe your camera lens before shooting. A clean lens = sharp photos.

## 2. Use Natural Light

Shoot during golden hour (sunrise/sunset) for the best lighting.

## 3. Rule of Thirds

Enable grid lines and place subjects at intersection points.

## 4. HDR Mode

Use HDR for high-contrast scenes (bright sky + dark foreground).

## 5. Avoid Digital Zoom

Move closer instead of zooming. Digital zoom reduces quality.

## 6. Tap to Focus

Tap your subject on screen to ensure it's in focus.

## 7. Edit, Don't Overdo

Use editing apps sparingly. Natural looks better.

## 8. Shoot in Burst Mode

Capture moving subjects with burst mode, then pick the best shot.

## 9. Experiment with Angles

Don't shoot everything at eye level. Try low and high angles.

## 10. Backup to Photo Cloud

Always backup your photos to Photo Cloud for safe storage.

## Bonus: Composition Tips

- Use leading lines
- Frame your subject
- Look for patterns and symmetry
- Include foreground interest

Happy shooting!

# The 3-2-1 Backup Rule: Never Lose Your Photos Again

Data loss happens. Hard drives fail, phones get stolen, and accidents occur. But with the right backup strategy, you can ensure your photos are always safe. The 3-2-1 rule is the gold standard used by professionals worldwide.

## What is the 3-2-1 Backup Rule?

The 3-2-1 rule is simple but effective:

**3** - Keep THREE copies of your data
**2** - Store copies on TWO different types of media
**1** - Keep ONE copy offsite (cloud storage)

### Why It Works

This strategy protects against:
- Hardware failure
- Theft or loss
- Natural disasters
- Ransomware attacks
- Accidental deletion
- Corruption

## Breaking Down the Rule

### Copy #1: Original Files (Primary Storage)

Your main working copy on your computer or phone.

**Best Practices:**
- Use SSD for speed and reliability
- Organize files systematically
- Regular maintenance and cleanup
- Keep at least 20% free space

### Copy #2: Local Backup (Secondary Storage)

A backup on different media in the same location.

**Options:**
- External hard drive (HDD/SSD)
- NAS (Network Attached Storage)
- Second computer
- Time Machine/Windows Backup

**Recommended Schedule:**
- Daily: Incremental backups
- Weekly: Full system backup
- Monthly: Verification check

### Copy #3: Offsite Backup (Cloud Storage)

Remote storage that survives local disasters.

**Best Solutions:**
- Photo Cloud (optimized for photographers)
- Backblaze B2
- Amazon S3 (for large volumes)
- Google Drive/Dropbox (general use)

**Key Features to Look For:**
- Automatic sync
- Version history
- End-to-end encryption
- Unlimited file size
- RAW file support

## Implementation Guide

### For Beginners

**Setup (1-2 hours):**

1. **Primary**: Keep photos on your computer
2. **Secondary**: Buy a 2TB external drive ($60-80)
3. **Offsite**: Sign up for Photo Cloud (free 1GB, then upgrade)

**Maintenance:**
- Connect external drive weekly
- Cloud syncs automatically
- Check backups monthly

### For Enthusiasts

**Setup (3-4 hours):**

1. **Primary**: Main computer with 1TB+ SSD
2. **Secondary**: 4TB NAS with RAID 1 mirror
3. **Offsite**: Photo Cloud Pro + Backblaze

**Maintenance:**
- NAS syncs nightly
- Cloud continuous sync
- Quarterly backup verification

### For Professionals

**Setup (Full day):**

1. **Primary**: Workstation with RAID 0 SSD array
2. **Secondary**: Dual NAS with RAID 6 (redundancy)
3. **Offsite**: Photo Cloud Business + S3 Glacier (archive)

**Maintenance:**
- Automated monitoring
- Monthly disaster recovery tests
- Quarterly drive health checks
- Annual system audits

## Cost Analysis

### Budget Setup ($100/year)
- External HDD: $70 one-time
- Photo Cloud 50GB: $2/month
- Total: $94 first year, $24/year after

### Standard Setup ($300/year)
- NAS 2-bay: $200 one-time
- 2x 4TB drives: $200 one-time
- Photo Cloud 200GB: $5/month
- Total: $460 first year, $60/year after

### Professional Setup ($1000+/year)
- NAS 4-bay: $500
- 4x 8TB drives: $800
- Photo Cloud Business 2TB: $20/month
- Backblaze Business: $7/month
- Total: $1,624 first year, $324/year after

## Automation is Key

Manual backups fail because humans forget. Automate everything:

### macOS
- Time Machine (included, automatic)
- Photo Cloud app (automatic sync)
- Carbon Copy Cloner (bootable backup)

### Windows
- Windows Backup (included)
- Photo Cloud app (automatic sync)
- Acronis True Image (comprehensive)

### Linux
- rsync scripts (free, powerful)
- Photo Cloud web (manual upload)
- Timeshift (system snapshots)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: All Backups in Same Location
**Problem**: Fire/flood destroys everything
**Solution**: Cloud backup is mandatory

### Mistake #2: Never Testing Restores
**Problem**: Discover backup is corrupted when you need it
**Solution**: Restore random files monthly

### Mistake #3: Using Only Cloud
**Problem**: Slow restores, internet dependency
**Solution**: Local backup for quick recovery

### Mistake #4: Forgetting About Versions
**Problem**: Overwrite good file with corrupted one
**Solution**: Use services with version history

### Mistake #5: No Encryption
**Problem**: Privacy breach if device stolen
**Solution**: Encrypt all backups, especially cloud

## Beyond 3-2-1: The 3-2-1-1-0 Rule

Modern best practice adds two more numbers:

**3-2-1-1-0:**
- 3 copies of data
- 2 different media types
- 1 copy offsite
- **1** copy offline (air-gapped)
- **0** errors after verification

### Offline Backup

Keep one backup completely disconnected:
- External drive stored safely
- Update monthly or quarterly
- Protection against ransomware
- Ultimate disaster recovery

## Photo Cloud Advantage
